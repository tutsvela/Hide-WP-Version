# Hide WordPress Theme and Plugin Information for Enhanced Security

This snippet provides a robust solution to hide your WordPress theme and plugin information from scanners and tools that attempt to identify them. It adds an extra layer of security by obscuring critical data, making it significantly harder for attackers or automated bots to gather information about your site.

## Features
- **Hide WordPress Theme Information:**
  - Removes theme name and version from asset URLs (scripts and styles).
  - Blocks direct access to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory.
  
- **Hide WordPress Plugin Information:**
  - Removes plugin name and version from asset URLs.
  - Blocks direct access to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
  
- **Prevent REST API Information Leak:**
  - Restricts REST API endpoints from exposing theme and plugin data.

- **Clean Up Debug Information:**
  - Removes theme and plugin details from WordPress debug data (Tools > Site Health).

- **Custom `.htaccess` Rules:**
  - Adds rules to block directory listing for themes and plugins.

## Installation
1. Copy the PHP snippet from [this file](#).
2. Paste the code into your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file or use a custom plugin for added portability.

## Usage
- Once implemented, this snippet will automatically:
  - Obscure theme and plugin information in frontend asset URLs.
  - Block directory access to theme and plugin folders.
  - Restrict sensitive data from being exposed through REST API or debug tools.

### Note:
For complete protection, ensure your server has **directory listing disabled** (e.g., set `Options -Indexes` in `.htaccess`).
